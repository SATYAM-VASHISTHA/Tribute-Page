        also included efforts to improve relations with Pakistan and navigate
        complex political challenges. Renowned for his eloquence and pragmatic

            <p>
              As his parliamentary career flourished, Vajpayee made a name for
              himself as an orator and for his poetic flourishes. Vajpayee, as a
              member of the Jan Sangh, paid a glowing tribute to Jawaharlal
              Nehru, in the Rajya Sabha. He described Mr. Nehru as a thoroughly
              honest man and an idealist “who was never afraid to negotiate and
              never negotiated with fear”. Though he differed in his views from
              Mr. Nehru, he burst into tears both in the Upper House and in the
              all-parties meeting in the Central Hall while paying homage to Mr.
              Nehru in poetic and chaste Hindi.<br />

              According to The Hindu , Vajpayee was a firm believer in
              secularism. He was fond of repeating that “Hinduism was not a
              religion but a secular way of life,” a report published in The
              Hindu on June 13, 1964 read.

              fragile coalition that he had put together, and with the AIADMK
